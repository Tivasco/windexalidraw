# Security Overview

This document provides an overview of the security principles and best practices implemented in the WebApp Boilerplate.

## Security Principles

The security implementation in this boilerplate follows these key principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented.
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and processes have only the minimum necessary permissions.
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default.
4. **Fail Securely**: When failures occur, the system defaults to a secure state.
5. **Open Design**: Security doesn't rely on obscurity but on well-tested mechanisms.
6. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are verified.
7. **Separation of Duties**: Critical actions require multiple approvals.
8. **Psychological Acceptability**: Security mechanisms are user-friendly.

## Security Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication.
- **Keycloak Integration**: Enterprise-grade identity and access management.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different access levels based on user roles.
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh of authentication tokens.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts.

See [Authentication](./authentication.md) for more details.

### Data Protection

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications are encrypted using TLS.
- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded when output to prevent injection attacks.

See [Data Protection](./data-protection.md) for more details.

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks.
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings.
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrictions on content sources.
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security-related HTTP headers.
- **API Authentication**: All API endpoints require proper authentication.

### Frontend Security

- **XSS Prevention**: Measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CSRF Protection**: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery.
- **Secure Cookie Configuration**: Cookies are configured with secure attributes.
- **Client-side Validation**: Input validation on the client side.
- **Secure State Management**: Secure handling of application state.

### Infrastructure Security

- **Docker Security**: Secure Docker configuration.
- **Environment Isolation**: Separation of development, staging, and production environments.
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies to address vulnerabilities.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events.
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.

## Security Testing

The boilerplate includes several security testing mechanisms:

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Checking dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Security Headers Testing**: Verification of security-related HTTP headers.
- **Authentication Testing**: Testing of authentication mechanisms.
- **Authorization Testing**: Testing of access control mechanisms.

## Security Response

In case of security incidents:

1. **Identification**: Quickly identify the security breach.
2. **Containment**: Contain the breach to prevent further damage.
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the breach.
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve security measures.
